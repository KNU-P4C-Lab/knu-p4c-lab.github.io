# Research Interest
My research interest is to devise persuasive and interactive systems that support health behavior change by leveraging pervasive sensing, context-aware computing, and machine learning. One of my research achievements is to build exertion-based games for multiple swimmers, where I tackled several challenges, including underwater communication via off-the-shelf network technologies, recognition of different swimming styles/motions for utilizing them as inputs to the game and designing games concerning limited sensory and cognitive resources during swimming. Another approach is to explore a physically active workspace with active workstations, in which I studied the effects of dual-tasking (i.e., simultaneous execution of a desk-based task and workout using active workstations) and temporal changes in motivations on the usage of active workstations. The recent research focuses on devising a just-in-time adaptive intervention that provides the right type of support at the right time. To this end, through statistical analysis, I have explored contextual and cognitive factors on the receptivity to just-in-time support. In addition, I am on track to (1) building a machine-learning model to predict receptivity using high-dimensional mobile data and (2) devising incentivized interventions. In the latter research, an incentive is dynamically changed regarding previous response behaviors on interventions and contextual factors by leveraging reinforcement learning and multi-armed bandit.
