The project *Future Smart Home* has come to fruition. Collaborating with the Interactive Computing Lab at KAIST, we published a paper titled "FamilyScope: Visualizing Affective Aspects of Family Social Interactions using Passive Sensor Data" in Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction. In addition, this paper will be presented at the ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW) '24.

In this work, we explore family informatics using wearable sensor data to allow family members to reflect their members' affective aspects during the family's social activities. For this, we implemented FamilyScope, which visualizes affective and behavioral elements from wearable sensor readings, and conducted a user study with ten families (n = 30) in a smart home testbed. Our findings indicate that such a family informatics tool helps family members understand other member's affective and behavioral responses during family social interaction and gain new insights about each other.
