description: "This course aims to provide broad knowledge about interaction design methods and principles for better usability through hands-on experiences in user-centered design sessions. The course covers well-known design principles on usability aspects (e.g., learnability, efficiency, human errors) and design methodologies (e.g., user-centered design, task analysis, prototyping, heuristic evaluation, and user testing). Design assignments and term projects will help students enhance their user interface design skills in web, mobile, and IoT environments."
