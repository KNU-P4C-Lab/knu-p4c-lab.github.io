title: "인간-컴퓨터 상호작용 / Human-Computer Interaction"
year: 2024
semester: spring
division: "2분반"
description: "This course aims to provide broad knowledge about interaction design methods and principles for better usability through hands-on experiences in user-centered design sessions. The course covers well-known design principles on usability aspects (e.g., learnability, efficiency, human errors) and design methodologies (e.g., user-centered design, task analysis, prototyping, heuristic evaluation, and user testing). Design assignments and term projects will help students enhance their user interface design skills in web, mobile, and IoT environments."
