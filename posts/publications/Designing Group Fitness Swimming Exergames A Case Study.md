# Abstract
Recently, HCI-related communities have explored ways to enhance conventional group fitness through interactive technologies. As one such approach, we considered how to design exertion games (exergames) for group fitness. In this poster, we examined group fitness swimming as a case study, and designed SwimTrain, an exergame for this group activity. Our game focuses on helping multiple swimmers set and maintaining an appropriate exercise intensity through both competition and collaboration. We also explored several implementation issues, such as device settings, input methods, and game feedback.
