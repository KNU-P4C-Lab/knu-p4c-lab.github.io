# Abstract
This work presents FamilyScope, a sensor-based family informatics system that enables reflection upon family data collected from family activity scenarios (e.g., game playing and movie watching) that include affective aspects of a family's social interactions. We conducted a user study with ten families (n=30) in a smart home testbed to observe how our system supports data reflection of the affective and behavioral states among family members. Our findings showed that FamilyScope facilitated family data reflection on affective and behavioral aspects of family interactions. Overall, families reported that the system well reflected family members' general tendencies in terms of affective and behavioral responses and even helped them gain new insights about each other. Based on the findings, we provide practical design approaches for collective reflection in family informatics systems.
