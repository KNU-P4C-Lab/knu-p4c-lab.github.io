# Abstract
With the popularization of low-cost mobile and wearable sensors, several studies have used them to track and analyze mental well-being, productivity, and behavioral patterns. However, there is still a lack of open datasets collected in real-world contexts with affective and cognitive state labels such as emotion, stress, and attention; the lack of such datasets limits research advances in affective computing and human-computer interaction. This study presents K-EmoPhone, a real-world multimodal dataset collected from 77 students over seven days. This dataset contains (1) continuous probing of peripheral physiological signals and mobility data measured by commercial off-the-shelf devices, (2) context and interaction data collected from individualsâ€™ smartphones, and (3) 5,582 self-reported affect states, including emotions, stress, attention, and task disturbance, acquired by the experience sampling method. We anticipate the dataset will contribute to advancements in affective computing, emotion intelligence technologies, and attention management based on mobile and wearable sensor data.
