# Abstract
The unique aquatic nature of swimming makes it very difficult to use social or technical strategies to mitigate the tediousness of monotonous exercises. In this study, we propose MobyDick, a smartphone-based multi-player exergame designed to be used while swimming, in which a team of swimmers collaborate to hunt down a virtual monster. In this paper, we present a novel, holistic game design that takes into account both human factors and technical challenges. Firstly, we perform a comparative analysis of a variety of wireless networking technologies in the aquatic environment and identify various technical constraints on wireless networking. Secondly, we develop a single phone-based inertial and barometric stroke activity recognition system to enable precise, real-time game inputs. Thirdly, we carefully devise a multi-player interaction mode viable in the underwater environment highly limiting the abilities of human communication. Finally, we prototype MobyDick on waterproof off-the-shelf Android phones, and deploy it to real swimming pool environments (n = 8). Our qualitative analysis of user interview data reveals certain unique aspects of multi-player swimming games.
