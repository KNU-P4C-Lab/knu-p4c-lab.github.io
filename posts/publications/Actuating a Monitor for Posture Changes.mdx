# Abstract
The position and orientation of a monitor affects users' behavior at their desk. In this study, we explored and designed six types of interactions between an actuated monitor and users to induce posture changes. We built a virtual monitor that simulates the motions of an actuated monitor and slowly moved in the opposite direction of unbalanced sitting postures. We conducted an explorative study with eight participants. The study showed participants' responses and step by step posture changes toward balanced sitting postures. As contribution, we share considerations for designing monitor actuation that induce posture intervention.
