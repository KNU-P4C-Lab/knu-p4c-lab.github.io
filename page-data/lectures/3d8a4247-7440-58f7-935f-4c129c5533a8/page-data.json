In this paradigm, agents learn the optimal policies by repeatedly interacting with an environment to maximize (cumulative) rewards. This course will cover the foundational concepts of RL, including state-action-reward pairs, the Markov decision process, and exploration versus exploitation. In addition, we will learn key RL algorithms, such as the Monte Carlo method, temporal difference learning, function approximation, and policy gradients.
